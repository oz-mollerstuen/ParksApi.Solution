## Technologies Used



* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)_
* [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/)
* [Entity Framework Core 6.0.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)

* [Postman](postman.com)


### Description
An API that functions as a recipe archive for coffee drinks from around the world. It utilizes RESTful principles, version control, pagination, and has integrated authentication to keep the API Read-Only for all users except administrators. The user is able to see the in-use version of the API when using Postman.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository to your desktop from: https://github.com/DavidDGamble/TravelApi.Solution.git_
* _Create appsettings.json file in ASPNETIdentityRoles folder_

```
{
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
      }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[DATABASE_NAME];uid=[USERNAME];pwd=[PASSWORD];"
    }
  }

```
* _run dotnet commands below in _TravelApi_
```
dotnet restore
```
```
dotnet ef database update
```
```
dotnet watch run
```
 #### Launch the API
  1) Navigate to TravelApi.Solution/TravelApi directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell (e.g. `cd Desktop/TravelApi.Solution/TravelApi`).
  2) Run the command `dotnet run` to have access to the API in Postman or browser.

------------------------------

## API Documentation
Explore the API endpoints in Postman or a browser. You will not be able to utilize authentication in a browser.

### Using Swagger Documentation 
To explore the Travel-Api with NSwag, launch the project using `dotnet run` with the Terminal or Powershell, and input the following URL into your browser: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### Endpoints
Base URL: `https://localhost:5000`

#### HTTP Request Structure
```
GET /api/{component}
PUT /api/{component}
DELETE /api/{component}/{id}
GET /api/{component}/{id}
POST /api/{component}/{id}
```

#### Example Query

```
https://localhost:5001/api/Destinations/1

```

#### Sample JSON Response
``` {
  "destinationId": 1,
  "name": "portland",
  "reviews": null
} 
```

#### Example Query

```
https://localhost:5001/api/Reviews/5

```
#### Sample JSON Response
``` 
{
  "reviewId": 5,
  "summary": "gresham sucks",
  "rating": 2,
  "destinationId": 2
}
```

## Known Bugs

* _Branch "Further" will not run_


# Branch "Further" was created as a further exploration into Authentication using a token based system:

### Research done using:
* [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.securitytokenhandler.validatetoken?view=netframework-4.8.1)_
* [DotNet Tutorials](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/token-based-authentication-web-api/)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44808800/how-do-i-manually-validate-a-jwt-asp-net-core)
* [Dev](https://dev.to/moe23/refresh-jwt-with-refresh-tokens-in-asp-net-core-5-rest-api-step-by-step-3en5)

### While "Further" has yet to work in such a small amount of time I know that I will get it there soon, and will, hopefully, be using it in my next project.
